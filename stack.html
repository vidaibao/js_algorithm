        <p>A stack is an ordered collection of items that follows the last in, first out
            (LIFO) principle. The addition of new items or the removal of existing items
            takes place at the same end. The end of the stack is known as the top, and the
            opposite side is known as the base. The newest elements are near the top, and the
            oldest elements are near the base.</p>
